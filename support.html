        <p id="sectioninfo">
            About half of all people who experience a mental health condition in their lifetime begin experiencing symptoms before the age of 14, but other teens and their family members often do not notice 
            them until several years later. Determining whether certain behavior is normal/typical or a symptom of a mental health condition can be difficult. It can be even harder for young people who live 
            in a low-income household or who are part of communities that experience prejudice, racism, exclusion or marginalization. The good news is that if you ask for help and support early on, you can 
            find healthy ways to help you get through your teen years and prepare for life as a young adult — even if you have a mental health condition.
