            <p id="abstract-text">As the COVID-19 pandemic has continued through the past two years in the US, high school students have shown to be particularly impacted in regards to mental health by the long-lasting effects of the pandemic, making research into the matter imperative to the wellbeing of the youth of America. This report is to document and analyze the level of impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the mental wellbeing, academics, and daily life of high schoolers in the Charlotte area. This current investigation used an online survey distributed via social media among the largest high schools in Charlotte, North Carolina, USA to analyze the impact of the pandemic through the lens of mental health issues, daily life, and academic concerns.
                Of the 102 participants, 70.6% (72 students) reported a worsening of feelings of both anxiety and depression compared to before the pandemic. Suicidal thoughts were shown by 47.1% (48 students) and 6.9% (7 students) attempted to end their lives. Physical wellbeing also decreased, with 73.5% (75 students) being concerned to some degree about contracting COVID-19 or transmitting it to others. In fact, 23.5% (24 students) missed school because they got COVID-19. 55.9% (57 students) reported a worsening in their ability to perform daily activities, and 48% (49 students) reported a worsening in academic performance. In terms of coping mechanisms, the majority of them used positive methods including family and friends, relaxing activities, and technological support.
                
                As the pandemic has reached over 2 years now, the severity to which high school students have been affected by COVID-19 and the lifestyle alterations it brings is easily apparent: the changes in mental health, academics, and daily life have in large part all been for the worse. This makes it more imperative to develop solutions within school systems to aid and support high schoolers’ mental health and wellbeing, such as information websites.

            <p id="abstract-text">Disruptions and consequences related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including school closures, social isolation, family economic hardship, family loss or illness, and reduced access to health care, raise concerns about their effects on the mental health and well-being of youths. This report uses data from the 2021 Adolescent Behaviors and Experiences Survey, an online survey of a probability-based, nationally representative sample of U.S. public- and private-school students in grades 9–12 (N = 7,705), to assess U.S. high school students’ mental health and suicidality during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also examines whether mental health and suicidality are associated with feeling close to persons at school and being virtually connected to others during the pandemic. Overall, 37.1% of students experienced poor mental health during the pandemic, and 31.1% experienced poor mental health during the preceding 30 days. In addition, during the 12 months before the survey, 44.2% experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, 19.9% had seriously considered attempting suicide, and 9.0% had attempted suicide. Compared with those who did not feel close to persons at school, students who felt close to persons at school had a significantly lower prevalence of poor mental health during the pandemic (28.4% versus 45.2%) and during the past 30 days (23.5% versus 37.8%), persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness (35.4% versus 52.9%), having seriously considered attempting suicide (14.0% versus 25.6%), and having attempted suicide (5.8% versus 11.9%). The same pattern was observed among students who were virtually connected to others during the pandemic (i.e., with family, friends, or other groups by using a computer, telephone, or other device) versus those who were not. Comprehensive strategies that improve feelings of connectedness with others in the family, in the community, and at school might foster improved mental health among youths during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
