        <p id="sectioninfo">
            As COVID-19 vaccination rates rise and communities return to pre-pandemic lifestyles, many people are experiencing some anxiety or hesitancy about returning to old routines. Maybe you’re feeling uncertain about what your post-pandemic social life will look like, or you’re worried about not knowing who is or isn’t vaccinated as mask mandates come to an end. None of us have been through a global pandemic before, so it’s completely understandable to have some anxiety about this shift.
            <br><br>As the COVID-19 pandemic comes to an end, there are no campaigns helping us to reacclimate to our old lives, leaving many people feeling like they’re struggling alone. People also tend to process emotions after a traumatic event, not during – so having a tough time right now is to be expected. Wanting to get back into the swing of things but feeling like there’s a mental block holding you back can be frustrating.
            <br><br>Here are some tips to help you adjust:
            <br><span style="color: var(--second)">Accept your feelings.</span> Don’t be too hard on yourself if you aren’t ready to jump back into things. Your life may be quite different than it was before the COVID-19 pandemic. Acknowledging how you feel can help you to cope and move through those challenging emotions.   
            <br><span style="color: var(--second)">Start slow and small.</span> It’s common to avoid the things that make you anxious – but you usually need to face your fears head-on at some point to move past them. The best way to get more comfortable with post-pandemic life is to start living it. 
            <br><span style="color: var(--second)">Set boundaries.</span> We all have different comfort levels around pandemic safety, and some people will need more time to adjust than others. Setting boundaries can feel awkward, so take some time to think about what boundaries you need and your reasons for setting them so that you can go into social interactions feeling more prepared. 
            <br><span style="color: var(--second)">Find a buddy.</span> There’s likely someone in your life at a similar stage of re-entry comfort as you are. Tackle this challenging time together – you can hold each other accountable for taking steps forward while also being a safe and familiar face for each other as you navigate this “new normal.”
            <br><span style="color: var(--second)">Do something fulfilling.</span> It’s easier to be excited and motivated about communities reopening if you’re spending time with loved ones and doing things that you genuinely enjoy. 
            <br>Seek help if you need it. Adjusting to post-pandemic life is a pretty significant transition, and many people aren’t ready to move forward yet – that’s okay.
