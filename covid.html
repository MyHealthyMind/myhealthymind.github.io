            As COVID-19 spread throughout the United States, it not only resulted in greater morbidity and mortality in
            terms of physical health but also had disastrous effects on the mental health of the nation. As opposed to
            previous disasters in the United States that affected certain specific regions or populations where aid and trauma
            response could be concentrated, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire population of the country.
            While the risk of contracting the disease itself is a population-wide traumatizing event, our physical and social
            environments have changed as well, leading to greater rates of isolation and loneliness, financial hardship,
            housing and food insecurity, and interpersonal violence. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted and
            exacerbated existing inequities and injustices faced primarily by black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC)
            in the United States. Any of these factors by themselves can negatively affect the mental health of individuals,
            but in combination they have created a nationwide mental health crisis.

            <span id="header">Statistics</span><br><br>
            - The number of people looking for help with anxiety and depression has skyrocketed. From January
            to September 2020, <span style="color: var(--second)">315,220</span> people took the anxiety screen, a <span style="color: var(--second)">93 percent increase</span> over the 2019 total
            number of anxiety screens. <span style="color: var(--second)">534,784</span> people took the depression screen, a <span style="color: var(--second)">62 percent increase</span> over the
            2019 total number of depression screens.<br><br>
            - The number of people screening with moderate to severe symptoms of depression and anxiety has
            continued to increase throughout 2020 and remains higher than rates prior to COVID-19. In
            September 2020, the rate of moderate to severe anxiety peaked, with <span style="color: var(--second)">over 8 in 10 people</span> who took an
            anxiety screen scoring with moderate to severe symptoms. <span style="color: var(--second)">Over 8 in 10 people</span> who took a depression
            screen have scored with symptoms of moderate to severe depression consistently since the beginning of
            the pandemic in March 2020.<br><br>
            - More people are reporting frequent thoughts of suicide and self-harm than have ever been
            recorded in the MHA Screening program since its launch in 2014. Since the COVID-19 pandemic
            began to spread rapidly in March 2020, <span style="color: var(--second)">over 178,000 </span>people have reported frequent suicidal ideation. <span style="color: var(--second)">37 percent</span>
             of people reported having thoughts of suicide <span style="color: var(--second)">more than half or nearly every day</span> in September
            2020.<br><br>
            - Young people are struggling most with their mental health. The proportion of youth ages 11-17
            who accessed screening was <span style="color: var(--second)">9 percent higher</span> than the average in 2019. Not only are the number of
            youth searching for help with their mental health increasing, but throughout the COVID-19 pandemic
            youth ages 11-17 have been more likely than any other age group to score for moderate to severe
            symptoms of anxiety and depression.<br><br>
            - Rates of suicidal ideation are highest among youth, especially LGBTQ+ youth. In September 2020,
            <span style="color: var(--second)">over half of 11-17-year-olds</span> reported having thoughts of suicide or self-harm more than <span style="color: var(--second)">half or nearly
            every day</span> of the previous two weeks. From January to September 2020, <span style="color: var(--second)">77,470</span> youth reported
            experiencing frequent suicidal ideation, including <span style="color: var(--second)">27,980</span> LGBTQ+ youth.<br><br>
