            <br><span style="color: var(--second)">Increases Socialization: </span>Loneliness and social isolation are two severe epidemics in the world today that can lead to significant health risks. Although loneliness can affect anyone, older adults have a higher risk for loneliness and social isolation because they are more likely to face factors such as living alone and the loss of family or friends. Volunteering connects people and helps strengthen bonds between friends, family, and coworkers.    
            <br><br><span style="color: var(--second)">Improves Self-Esteem: </span>Volunteering can be life-changing in many ways, especially for those who suffer from low self-esteem. Helping others and the community can boost confidence by providing a sense of accomplishment. Volunteering can also give you a sense of pride and identity.
            <br><br><span style="color: var(--second)">Reduces Risk of Dementia: </span>Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia are frightening possibilities for millions of individuals. However, research has shown that volunteering may reduce the risk of dementia. Further studies indicate that social service improves elasticity in the brain. So, as volunteers age, volunteering may help them maintain the connections in their brains that often break down in patients with dementia.
            <br><br><span style="color: var(--second)">Improves Physical Health and Longevity: </span>Research shows that volunteers are healthier and have a lower mortality rate than those who do not volunteer. One study found that people who volunteer over 100 hours a year are some of the healthiest people in the US. Volunteering can also minimize chronic pain symptoms and reduce the risk of heart disease.
            <br><br><span style="color: var(--second)">Provides a Sense of Purpose and Direction: </span>Volunteering can add new meaning to the lives of young people who haven’t yet found their path and older adults, especially those who have retired or lost a spouse. Regardless of your age or life situation, volunteering can help take your mind off your worries, keep you mentally stimulated, and add more zest to your life.
            <br><br><span style="color: var(--second)">Increases Happiness: </span>Contemporary social neuroscience research shows that when people donate to charity, either financially or through volunteering, the mesolimbic system, the portion of the brain responsible for feelings of reward, is triggered. As a result, the brain releases feel-good chemicals, spurring you to perform more kind acts—something psychologists call “helper’s high.”
            <br><br><span style="color: var(--second)">Helps Counteract the Effects of Stress, Anger, Anxiety, and Depression: </span>Few things relieve stress better than a meaningful connection to another person. The social contact aspect of helping and working with others can profoundly affect your overall psychological well-being and help bolster your support system, which can protect you from anxiety and depression. 
            <br><br><span style="color: var(--second)">Increases Self-Confidence: </span>Doing good for others and the community provides a natural sense of accomplishment. Your role as a volunteer can also give you a sense of pride and identity. When you feel better about yourself, you are more likely to view your life and future goals positively. 

            <br><br><br><br>We encourage all youth to find local community service opportunities.<br><br>
            In Charlotte, North Carolina, we would like to recognize Cans for Kids, which is a nonprofit organization that provides volunteer opportunities to our students through food drives, fundraisers, and other service events.
