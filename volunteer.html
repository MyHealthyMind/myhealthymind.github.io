        <p id="header">The Benefits Of Volunteerism (Excerpt from a <a id="info" target="_blank" href="https://www.nami.org/Blogs/NAMI-Blog/February-2022/How-Volunteering-Improves-Mental-Health">NAMI</a> volunteer)</p>
        <p id="sectioninfo">
            <br><span style="color: var(--second)">Reducing Stress: </span>My work with NAMI demonstrates the ways in which volunteering can counteract the effects of stress, anger and anxiety. This kind of work was my first exploration into long-term volunteerism — and, as is my nature, I sometimes felt a little anxious as I prepared to lead an affiliate board meeting or teach or speak to a group on behalf of NAMI. But I always rose to the occasion because the cause mattered so greatly to me. And afterward, I would feel exhilarated and thrilled by my accomplishments. Gradually, my focus on the work, and the gratitude I received from it, surpassed other issues in my life that caused negative emotions. There was too much to accomplish and too much to look forward to for me to feel down. Ultimately, I noticed that I slept better at night with the knowledge that I was part of a greater good.   
            <br><br><span style="color: var(--second)">Increasing Happiness: </span>Research has found a correlation between volunteering and happiness. A 2020 study conducted in the United Kingdom found those who volunteered reported being more satisfied with their lives and rated their overall health as better. Respondents who volunteered for at least one month also reported having better mental health than those who did not volunteer.
            <br><br><span style="color: var(--second)">Developing Confidence: </span>Volunteering is an opportunity to develop confidence and self-esteem. Your role as a volunteer can also give you a sense of pride and identity, something that can be hard to come by for people with a mental health diagnosis. The better you feel about yourself, the more likely you are to have a positive view of your life and future. Moreover, I’ve found that the sense of accomplishment from serving others can raise self-esteem and self-confidence.
            <br><br><span style="color: var(--second)">Finding Purpose: </span>In times when you feel lost, volunteering can give you a sense of purpose. Dedicating time to a cause can give you new direction and allow you to find meaning in something unexpected. It can also take your mind off your own troubles while keeping you mentally stimulated.<br><br>I served for years as the president of my local NAMI affiliate’s board. I was the family and caregiver support group facilitator and, to this day, offer my services as a NAMI Family-to-Family certified instructor. My passion for offering education and support for people with lived experience and their families hasn’t waned because the need hasn’t waned.<br><br>The nights after I taught a class, led a support group meeting, or gave an interview to the local newspaper were the nights I felt most balanced and fulfilled. Knowing I am making a difference to any degree is the greatest feeling in the world.
